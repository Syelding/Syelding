Hi 👋 My name is Sheila Yelding
===============================

Data Analyst
------------

I've been learning and practicing Data Analytics for over a year. I absolutely love Python due to its versatility and it's straightforward syntax. I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualizations using Python and am interested in using it for Machine Learning. I am highly skilled at using Excel for Data cleaning and also have experience using Tableau for data visualizations. Last, I am also experienced with using the SQL language as well. I am eager to learn, curious, and also optimistic.
